            <h1>Want to know a little about me?</h1>
           <h3>Chapter One</h3> <p>Born and raised outside DC. I spent the first part of my life playing every sport that was offered. I was extremely active and enjoyed being outside and around people.  Before 6th grade, I moved to Austin where I spent three incredibly eye opening years before returning to DC. During my short stint in Austin, I fell in love with barbeque, water sports, and football.</p>
            <h3>Chapter Two</h3>
<p>Back in DC, everything felt strange as life kicked into high gear again.  Being used to the east-coast pace made it easy to coast all the way through high school. I found myself graduating and getting ready to move to Philly and become a Quaker. From day one as a quaker my life revloved around Lacrosse.  That remains true even to today. I spent 4 wonderful years at UPenn only to realize that what I was building wasn't for me.  What would I do? Say goodbye to Philly and hello to Boulder. Since I've lived in Boulder, I have become deeply invested in every part of my life.  My journey is just beginning as today is the beginning of the most exciting chapter yet.</p>
            <h3>Chapter Three</h3><p>gSchool</p>
             <h3>What happens next?</h3><p>I'm an outdoor junkie with a passion for challenges.  After gSchool, I hope to continue learning the trade and using my newfound skills to build scalable products that help everyday life. My goal is to become a proficient coder and designer with a focus on simple effective yet moving products.  </p>
